# fracn
Verilog testbench generator has been added to perl script.

Original versions can be found [here](http://fractional-divider.tripod.com/).

Just use the instruction the same as the one from the main developer. Beside that, you should see a generated verilog testbench named `tb_fracn09.v` by performing tests with `fracn09.pl` file.
